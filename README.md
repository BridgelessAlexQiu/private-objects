# private-objects

imgdl.py requires selenium:

`` pip install selenium ``


feeder.py should be placed in the folder containing the darknet program. By default it searches for images in a folder named 'train'


Both windows and linux versions of chrome driver are included.

## After successfully configured the darknet, before running the program, please:##
1. Move the `darknet` directory into the `private-objects` directory
2. Move `feeder.py` and `train` (directory) into the `darknet` directory
